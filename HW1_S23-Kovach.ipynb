    "<font size=+3>&#9998;</font> Debugging is a process used in coding where you find and fix the errors and bugs within your code. How I usually start debugging is by running the code and reading the error message if there is any. The error message usually shows the line that the bug is occuring at. Some of the common error messages that bugs will produce are invalid syntax, where you have to mkae usre you are using the correct formatting accroding to pyhton, another example that I have fallen victim to is mixing up or mispelling variables, this is one of the little ones that can sneak up on you. You can find yourself asking the code to compute the wrong thing due to this or it will be confused about an identified variable. If you recieve an error code that wasn't any of those or you haven't seen before I recommend searching up the error or the method of coding that you are using. Google is a very important tool that you can utilize in this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes when  you run the code there is no error in the output, but you can tell it is not giving you the correct answer. So what I would do is read through the question and be sure to understand exactly what the code is asking for. After reading through it I will go through line by line and try to determine what each line of code is doing and how it is going to help answer the question. If there is any obvious parts of the question left unanswered or not computed I will try to see how I can incorperate it as well as if there is any portion of the code that I don't know why it is included I will take it out or edit it to do the correct thing. After all that if I still can't figure it out I will again use resources like google and try to find something that might be helpful. However my favorite resource to use is office hours. I find it very helpful to be able to walk through and directly ask a TA/ULA/Professor that most likely knows whats going on and has seen similar problems. For me personally I am more likely to learn from talking through it with someone than I am reading about it online. "

So I moved the second plt.scatter to just below the first and I moved the plt.legend to just below both the plt.scatter. This then plotted both of the data sets onto one plot and included a legend to differentiate the two data sets. I read through the code and question again to be sure that the problem was answered and it was."
